# What is VueJS?

### Uses
- Build stand-alone components / widgets
- Non-Vue websites require calls to server for every page refresh
- Vue - we initially get a bare-bones page as an SPA from the server upon the initial request, along with a Vue Javascript bundle - when we navigate to different pages, VueJS is simply swapping out component views.


## Vue3 New Features:
- **Composition API**, improves reusability and organisation, giving us a setup() function inside components
- **Multiple root elements** for a component template (e.g. two `<div>` root elements)
- **Teleport component** - render content from a component in a different part of the DOM - e.g. good for modals.
- **Suspense component** - handle asynchronous components easily, also providing fallback content until the data is loaded (e.g. a spinner)
- **Typescript** support 
- **Multiple v-models** for custom components
- Improved **reactivity**
- Improved **performance**
